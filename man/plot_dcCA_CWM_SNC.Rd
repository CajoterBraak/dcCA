\title{Plot the CWMs and SNCs of a single dc-CA axis.}
\usage{
plot_dcCA_CWM_SNC(
  object,
  axis = 1,
  envfactor = NULL,
  traitfactor = NULL,
  facet = TRUE,
  newnames = NULL,
  remove.centroids = FALSE,
  with_lines = TRUE,
  getPlotdata2plotdCCA = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{results from \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}} of class \code{dccav}.}

\item{axis}{the axis number to get (default 1).}

\item{envfactor}{name of row factor to display as color and lines in the CWM plot (default \code{NULL}).
The default extracts the factor from the environmental model.
If set to \code{NA}, no additional coloring or lines are displayed.}

\item{traitfactor}{name of column factor to display as color and lines in the SNC plot (default \code{NULL}).
The default extracts the factor from the trait model.
If set to \code{NA}, no additional coloring or lines are displayed.}

\item{facet}{logical. Default \code{TRUE} for CWMs and SNCs plots in separate panels.
This parameter changes the position of the centroid names (from left to right for the environmental
centroids).
If \code{facet = TRUE} and \code{with_lines = TRUE}, the line fits ignore groups of species and of sites.}

\item{newnames}{a list  with two elements:
names for traits and for environmental variables, default \code{NULL} for
names derived from the result of \code{\link{scores.dccav}} with \code{tidy=TRUE}.}

\item{with_lines}{logical. Default \code{TRUE} for straight lines though groups of points.
\code{traitfactor = NA} and \code{envfactor = NA}. Centroids are not displayed in this case.}

\item{getPlotdata2plotdCCA}{the results of an \code{\link{getPlotdata}}. Default \code{NULL}.}
}
\description{
\code{plot_dcCA_CWM_SNC} plots the CWMs and SNCs of a dc-CA axis against this axis,
 with optional centroids and colors for groups of sites and/or species if available in the data.
}
\details{
The lines with \code{with_lines=TRUE} do no use the weights in this version and
give an extra band for an not-existing line (for missing centroids).
The argument \code{getPlotdata2plotdCCA} is to allow some modifications of the data frame resulting
from \code{\link{getPlotdata}}. The variable names and score levels should remain untouched.
\code{plot_dcCA_CWM_SNC} uses the variables: \code{"dcCA\emph{k}"} with axis number \emph{k} and
\code{"CWM-SNC", "groups", "points", "sizeweight"} for the y-axis, coloring, shape and size of
items, respectively.
