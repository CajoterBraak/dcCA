\title{Double constrained correspondence analysis for multi-trait multi-environment analysis}
\description{
dcCA analyzes multi-trait multi-environment ecological data by double constrained correspondence analysis (ter Braak et al. 2018) using \code{vegan}, \code{ade4} and native R code. Throughout the two step algorithm of ter Braak et al. (2018) is used. This algorithm combines and extends community- (sample-) and species-level analyses, i.e. the usual community weigthed means (CWM)-based regression analysis and the species-level analysis of species-niche centroids (SNC)-based regression analysis. The two steps use \code{\link[vegan]{cca}} to regress the abundance data on to the traits and \code{\link[vegan]{rda}} to regress the CWM of the orthonormalized traits on to the environemtal predictors. The abundance data are divided by the sample total (i.e. 'closed') in the vegan-based version. This has the advantage that this multivariate analysis corresponds with an unweighted (multi-trait) community-level analysis, instead of being weighted. The current vegan-based analysis is efficient for sample-based permutation tests but slow or -not yet available- for species-based permutation tests. The technical reason for the closure, is that \code{vegan} \code{\link[vegan]{rda}} cannot do a weighted analysis. The main user function is \code{\link{dcCA}} . The easiest example is the code demo \code{dune}.
