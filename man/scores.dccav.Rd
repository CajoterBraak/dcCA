\title{Extract results of a vegan-based double constrained correspondence Analysis (dc-CA)}
\usage{
\method{scores}{dccav}(
  x,
  choices = c(1, 2),
  display = c("all"),
  which_cor = "in model",
  tidy = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object}

\item{choices}{integer vector of which axes to obtain. Default: all dc-CA axes.}

\item{display}{a character vector, one or more of
\code{c("all","species","sites","sp", "wa", "lc","bp", "cor", "reg", "cn",
"lc_traits", "reg_traits", "cor_traits")}.
The first ten are as in \code{\link[vegan]{scores.cca}} (except \code{"cor"})
and remaining ones are similar scores for traits.}

\item{which_cor}{character or list of trait and environmental variables names in the data frames
for which inter-set correlations must calculated.
Default: a character ("in_model") for all traits and variables in the model,
including collinear variables and levels.}

\item{tidy}{Return scores that are compatible with \code{ggplot2}:
all scores are in a single data.frame, score type is identified by factor variable \code{score},
the names by variable \code{label}, and species weights (in dc_CA_vegan) are in variable \code{weight}.
See \code{\link[vegan]{scores.cca}}.}
}
\description{
This function works very much like the \code{vegan} \code{\link[vegan]{scores}} function,
in particular \code{\link[vegan]{scores.cca}}, with the additional results such
as regression coefficients and linear combinations of traits \code{('regr_traits','lc_traits')}
In the current version, there is a single scaling (\code{scaling = "sites"}).
All scores from CA obey the so called transition formulas and so do the scores of CCA and dc-CA.
The differences are, for CCA, that the linear combinations of environmental variables
(the \emph{constrained} site scores)
replace the usual (\emph{unconstrained}) site scores, and for dc-CA,
that the linear combinations of traits (the \emph{constrained} species scores)
also replace the usual (\emph{unconstrained}) species scores.
}
\details{
In current version: no \code{biplot} scores for traits.
In current version: no \code{centroid} scores for traits.
