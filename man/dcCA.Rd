\title{The package dcCA performs double constrained correspondence analysis for trait-environment analysis in ecology}
\description{
The \code{dcCA} package analyzes multi-trait multi-environment ecological data by
double constrained correspondence analysis (ter Braak et al. 2018) using \code{vegan} and native R code.
It has a \code{formula} interface which allows to assess, for example, the importance
of trait interactions in shaping ecological communities.
Throughout the two step algorithm of ter Braak et al. (2018) is used. This algorithm
combines and extends community- (sample-) and species-level analyses, \emph{i.e.}
the usual community weighted means (CWM)-based regression analysis and the
species-level analysis of species-niche centroids (SNC)-based regression analysis.
The SNC is the center of the realized niche of the species along an environmental variable or,
in the case of dc-CA, an environmental gradient, \emph{i.e.} the dc-CA ordination axis.
Computationally, dc-CA can be carried out by a single singular value decomposition (ter Braak et al. 2018),
but it is here computed in two steps.
In \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}}, the first step uses \code{\link[vegan]{cca}} to regress the (transposed)
abundance data on to the traits
and the second step uses \code{\link[vegan]{rda}} to regress the
CWMs of the orthonormalized traits on to the environmental predictors.
The second step is thus a community-level analysis.
The abundance data are divided by the sample total
(i.e. 'closed') in the vegan-based version. This
has the advantage that this multivariate analysis corresponds with an unweighted (multi-trait)
community-level analysis, instead of being weighted.

In \code{\link{anova_species}}, the first step extracts the SNCs with respect to the ordination axes
from an existing dc-CA analysis (the SNCs, more precisely, a rotated version thereof, could have been obtained from a \code{\link[vegan]{cca}}
to regress the abundance data on to the environmental variables), and then
applies a weighted redundancy analysis of these SNCs with the traits as predictors. The second step is thus
a species-level analysis, but the final result (eigenvalues/ordination axes) is identical with that of the
analyses steps in \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}} in which the second step is a community-level analysis.
The current vegan-based analysis is computationally efficient for community-level (site-based) permutation tests
but a factor 20 or so slower for species-level permutation tests.
The technical reason for the closure, is that \code{vegan} \code{\link[vegan]{rda}} cannot do a weighted analysis.

Warning: The \code{dcCA} package was built from \code{vegan} version 2.6-4 and uses some of the
internal structure of the \code{vegan} \code{\link[vegan]{cca.object}}
in the not-exported functions \code{f_inertia} and \code{get_QR}
in the source code file \code{functions_using_cca_object_internals.r}.

The main user-functions are \code{\link{dc_CA_vegan}},\code{\link{plot_dcCA}}, \code{\link{scores.dccav}},
\code{\link{print.dccav}} and \code{\link{anova.dccav}}.
